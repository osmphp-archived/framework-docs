# Contributing To This Guide

This guide is work-in-progress. Used conventions, structure and ways to contribute are also incomplete and living document.

Contents:

{{ toc }}

## Conventions

* Mark unwritten contents with `TODO`
* When linking to a page which is not written yet, create an `.md` file for that page and leave a `TODO` comment in it
* If page URL changes, run search & replace in the rest content and correct links to it

## Structure

* **Core** (project directory structure, modules, themes, translations, packages, base class, properties, traits, environment variables, configuration files, cache, registries, logging)
* **Web Pages** (routes, controllers, pages, layers, views, Blade templates)
* **Scripts** (critical vs non-critical code, entry points, view models, controllers, Mustache templates) 
* **Styles** (entry point, BEM-like conventions)
* **Databases** (Laravel and our migrations, Laravel and formula queries, sheets)
* **UI Library** (icons, buttons, ...)
* **Other** (queues, cron jobs, writing console commands)
